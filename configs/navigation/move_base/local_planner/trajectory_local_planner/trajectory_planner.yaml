    #The maximum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec 

 min_vel_x  : 0.1

 escape_vel  : -0.1  

    #Speed used for driving during escapes in meters/sec. Note that it must be negative in order for the robot to actually reverse. A positive speed will cause the robot to move forward while attempting #to escape. New in navigation 1.3.1 

 holonomic_robot  : true  

    #Determines whether velocity commands are generated for a holonomic or non-holonomic robot. For holonomic robots, strafing velocity commands may be issued to the base. For non-holonomic robots, no #strafing velocity commands will be issued. 

#The following parameters are only used if holonomic_robot is set to true:

    #The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance when achieving a goal 

 latch_xy_goal_tolerance  : false  

    #If goal tolerance is latched, if the robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the goal tolerance while it is doing so. - New in navigation 1.3.1

###Trajectory Scoring Parameters

 meter_scoring  : false  

    #Whether the gdist_scale and pdist_scale parameters should assume that goal_distance and path_distance are expressed in units of meters or cells. Cells are assumed by default. New in navigation 1.3.1 

 pdist_scale : 0.9  

    #The weighting for how much the controller should stay close to the path it was given, maximal possible value is 5.0 

 gdist_scale : 0.6  

    #The weighting for how much the controller should attempt to reach its local goal, also controls speed, maximal possible value is 5.0 

 occdist_scale : 0.01

 heading_lookahead : 0.325

    #Whether to score based on the robot's heading to the path or its distance from the path 

 heading_scoring_timestep : 1.0  

    #How far to look ahead in time in seconds along the simulated trajectory when using heading scoring 

 dwa  : true  

    #Whether to use the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA  _ or whether to use Trajectory Rollout (NOTE: In our experience DWA worked as well as Trajectory Rollout and is computationally less expensive. It is possible that robots with extremely poor acceleration limits could gain from running Trajectory Rollout, but we recommend trying DWA first.   

 publish_cost_grid_pc  : false  

    #Whether or not to publish the cost grid that the planner will use when planning. When true, a sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 will be available on the  cost_cloud topic. Each point cloud represents the cost #grid and has a field for each individual scoring function component as well as the overall cost for each cell, taking the scoring parameters into account. New in navigation 1.4.0 

 
###Oscillation Prevention Parameters

 oscillation_reset_dist : 0.05  

    #How far the robot must travel in meters before oscillation flags are reset
