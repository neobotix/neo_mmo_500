sensor_ip: 192.168.1.30
#Sensor IP address. Can be passed as an argument to the launch file.

sensor_tcp_port: 2122
#Sensor TCP Port. Can be passed as an argument to the launch file.

host_ip: 192.168.1.10
#Host IP address. Can be passed as an argument to the launch file.

host_udp_port: 6060
#Host UDP Port. Zero allows system chosen port.

frame_id: laser_1_link
#The frame name of the sensor message

skip: 0
#The number of scans to skip between each measured scan. 
#For a 25Hz laser, setting 'skip' to 0 makes it publish at 25Hz, 
#'skip' to 1 makes it publish at 12.5Hz.

angle_start: 0.0
#Start angle of scan in radians, if both start and end angle are equal, all angels are regarded

angle_end: 0.0
#End angle of scan in radians, if both start and end angle are equal, all angels are regarded

channel_enabled: true
#If the channel should be enabled

general_system_state: true
#If the general system state should be published

derived_settings: true
#If the derived settings should be published

measurement_data: true
#If the measurement data should be published

intrusion_data: true
#If the intrusion data should be published

application_io_data: true
#If the application IO data should be published

use_sick_angles: false
#If this flag is set, the predefined angles from SICK are used. 
#If this flag is set to false an offset of -90\Uffffffff is added to the angles 
#so that 0\Uffffffff is at the front of the scanner.
